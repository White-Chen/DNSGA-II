%% function f  = genetic_operator(parent_chromosome, M, V, mu, mum, l_limit, u_limit)
% 
% This function is utilized to produce offsprings from parent chromosomes.
% The genetic operators corssover and mutation which are carried out with
% slight modifications from the original design. For more information read
% the document enclosed. 
%
% parent_chromosome - the set of selected chromosomes.
% M - number of objective functions
% V - number of decision varaiables
% mu - distribution index for crossover (read the enlcosed pdf file)
% mum - distribution index for mutation (read the enclosed pdf file)
% l_limit - a vector of lower limit for the corresponding decsion variables
% u_limit - a vector of upper limit for the corresponding decsion variables
%
% The genetic operation is performed only on the decision variables, that
% is the first V elements in the chromosome vector.
